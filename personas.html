            <!-- Simply get a feel for your interface and annotate 
            its key interactive components. In a caption, briefly explain the problem

            This Snackpass Self-Order Kiosk at Ten One Tea House allows customers a faster alternative 
            to order their drinks or pastries without the help of an employee. <br>
            Customers can navigate 
            through the menu using the touch screen display. Once they are ready to pay, they can simply 
            insert or tap their card on the provided scanner located directly beneath the screen.

        <h2> Observations and Interviews </h2>
        <p> 
            <!-- Write a few sentences or bullets describing the key observations you gained 
            from observing your users.  Do not make any assumptions about the usersâ€™ behaviors 
            or thought processes. <br> 
            Make sure you note general patterns in their interactions with 
            the interface. How did the users react while using the interface? How does it differ 
            from other users?  -->

            Overall, the three users interviewed seemed to interact very easily with the kiosk. They were able to quickly and without great
            difficulty navigate through the menu, find their desired item, and pay using a credit card. The only time that 
            users seemed to hesitate was in finding the credit card swiper, but it only took a second or two until they 
            realized that it was located directly below the screen. 
        </p>

            <!-- <li> List your questions in a numbered list and summarize the responses of 
                your interviewed users using up to 5 bullet points. </li> 
            <li> Be sure to highlight the main points or important patterns. Your summary 
                should be both concise and informative.</li> -->
            <li> What made you choose to order from the kiosk as opposed to the counter? <br>
                > It's usually faster, more efficient, and I can track the cost more easily.
            </li>
            <li> What was your goal with the kiosk, and did you achieve it? <br>
                > All users said their goal was to order a drink for a good price, and they were easily able to do so. 
            </li>
            <li> How did the time you took to use the kiosk compare to your expectations for how long it would take? <br>
                > Users said it either took as much time as expecting or less.
            </li>
            <li> Were there any positive or negative surprises when using this kiosk? <br>
                > Users were mainly surprised that it was so easy. One user noted that the ability to earn 
                Snackpass points was a pleasant surprise. 
            </li>
            <li> Next time you order from Ten One, would you use this kiosk or the counter to order and why? <br>
                > Would probably use the kiosk again because it was easier, faster, and could track cost, but if there was a line to the kiosk <br>
                and no one line to the counter, they would go to the counter.
